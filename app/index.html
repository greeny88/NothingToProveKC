										<h1>Nothing To Prove Book Tour - Kansas City</h1>
										<p>Join us for an evening of teaching by Jennie Allen, based on her new book <em>Nothing to Prove</em>. <em>Nothing to Prove</em> is a message of FREEDOM - freedom from pretending, from performing, from fighting to prove ourselves worthy. We ARE worthy - all because of Jesus.</p>
										<p>Jennie Allen is an award-winning and bestselling author of <em>Anything</em> and <em>Restless</em>, as well as the Bible studies 'Stuck', 'Chase', and 'Restless'. The founder and visionary for the IF: Gathering, she is a passionate leader following God's call on her life to catalyze a generation of women to live what they believe. Jennie has a master's in Biblical studies from Dallas Theological Seminary and lives in Austin, Texas, with her husband, Zac and their four children.</p>
										<p>Jennie will also be joined by special musical guest and worship leader, Ellie Holcomb. Ellie is a Dove-Award winning singer/songwriter from Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
										<p>We are excited to announce that International Justice Mission (IJM) will also be with us, featuring Anjali George. Anjali will be giving a first-hand account of the organization's global impact. She was a guest speaker at last year's IF:Gathering in which she shared her heart-wrenching testimony.</p>
